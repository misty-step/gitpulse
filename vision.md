# Vision

## One-Liner
Transform activity data into organizational intelligence — know who knows what, surface risks, and make better personnel decisions.

## North Star
**Pulse**: A unified pipeline that ingests activity from everywhere people work (GitHub, Slack, email, Salesforce) and synthesizes it into "demonstrations of knowledge" — cited, verifiable evidence of what each person knows and can do. Executives see the roadmap, backlog, and team composition side-by-side, with AI-powered insights about skill gaps, personnel vulnerabilities, and optimal team structure.

## Evolution Path

### Phase 1: Individual Reports (Current)
- Sync GitHub activity for individual developers
- Generate daily standups and weekly retros automatically
- Solve the "what did I actually do?" problem for ICs

### Phase 2: Team Reports (Next)
- Expand to team-level visibility
- Customizable report templates: time ranges, contributors, repos, orgs
- Scheduled reports: "Q1 summary for Alex, Jill, Bob across gateway and web repos"
- B2B focus — help non-technical stakeholders understand engineering work
- Support, product, and sales can track bug fixes and feature promises

### Phase 3: Knowledge Graph (Medium-term)
- Synthesize activity into understanding of *who knows what*
- Query interface: "Who should handle this Rails issue?"
- Expert routing: When someone asks a question, direct them to the right person
- Work assignment: Suggest optimal assignees based on demonstrated expertise

### Phase 4: Organizational Intelligence (Vision)
- Surface personnel vulnerabilities: "Only one person knows Rails — you're exposed"
- Upskill recommendations: "Sarah has transferable skills for this gap"
- Recruiting suggestions: Find developers on GitHub with needed skills
- Roadmap-aware: Align team capabilities with backlog requirements
- Executive dashboard: Roadmap + Backlog + Team Composition + Risk Analysis

### Phase 5: Pulse (Ultimate)
- Multi-source ingestion: GitHub + Slack + email + Salesforce + more
- Every interaction becomes a potential "demonstration of knowledge"
- Citations for every capability claim — traceable evidence
- Cross-functional: Beyond engineering to entire organization
- Strategic workforce planning powered by actual activity data

## Key Differentiators

1. **Citation-backed trust**: Every claim links to a verifiable source. No hallucinations, no guessing.
2. **Demonstrations of knowledge**: Activity isn't just logged — it's synthesized into evidence of capability.
3. **Bridge the language gap**: Help non-technical stakeholders understand engineering work without speaking Greek.
4. **Risk visibility**: Surface what's in people's heads — skill concentrations, bus factor, bottlenecks.
5. **Activity-grounded**: Based on what people actually do, not self-reported skills or outdated resumes.

## Target Users

### Today
- Individual contributors who lose track of their own work
- Developers preparing for standups, retros, performance reviews

### Next
- Engineering managers wanting team visibility without micromanagement
- Product managers tracking feature delivery and bug fix progress
- Support teams needing visibility into engineering work

### Vision
- Executives making personnel and team composition decisions
- HR/recruiting identifying skill gaps and finding candidates
- Cross-functional leaders understanding organizational capability

## Current Focus (Q1 2026)
Ship a launchable B2C product that proves the core value:
1. Polish onboarding (fix 24-hour time-to-value gap)
2. Stripe integration for monetization
3. Report sharing for viral growth
4. Landing page that communicates the citation-backed trust angle

Then validate B2B with team-level reports and templates.
